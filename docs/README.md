# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation for OctoAcme's project management processes. This README provides quick navigation and a summary of key workflows, roles, and best practices used by the team.

---

## Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative project management approach designed to deliver customer value efficiently while maintaining high quality and transparency. Our methodology emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety, ensuring teams can innovate while managing risks effectively.

The project lifecycle flows from **initiation** (defining problems, goals, and stakeholders) through **planning** (breaking down work, identifying dependencies, and setting milestones) to **execution and tracking** (daily standups, continuous integration, and risk monitoring). Each project culminates in **release and deployment** (following standardized checklists and quality gates) and concludes with a **retrospective** to capture learnings and drive continuous improvement.

Key **roles and personas** include the Project Manager (coordinating delivery and communications), Product Manager or Product Lead (defining outcomes and prioritizing the backlog), Developers (implementing features with quality and testability in mind), QA/Testing teams (validating acceptance criteria), and Stakeholders (providing inputs and approvals). Each role has defined responsibilities and communication patterns to ensure alignment.

**Communication and quality assurance** are cornerstones of our process. We maintain a single source of truth through project boards and documentation, provide regular status updates (weekly syncs, twice-weekly standups, monthly stakeholder briefings), and follow clear escalation paths. Quality is built in through PR conventions, continuous integration (CI), comprehensive testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), security scans, and release readiness checks before deployment.
